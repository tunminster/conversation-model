Conversation Model Training

Project Overview
This repository contains the code for training a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model using conversational data. The model is designed to understand and generate responses based on previous exchanges, which is fundamental for applications such as chatbots, customer service automation, and more. The model leverages TensorFlow and a LSTM-based architecture to handle sequence data effectively.

Features
Seq2Seq Model: Uses an LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture to process and generate text sequences.
Data Preprocessing: Includes tokenization and sequence padding to prepare text data for training.
Incremental Learning: Supports training the model incrementally with new data batches, simulating an online learning environment.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.6+
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt

Installation
To install the necessary Python packages and libraries, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Here’s a quick guide on how to train the model with your data:

Prepare your data: Your data should be formatted as a list of conversations, with each conversation containing sequential exchanges between a client and an agent.

Modify the data paths: Adjust the data loading paths and preprocessing steps as per your dataset structure.

Train the model:

Run the training script with:
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Evaluate the model: After training, evaluate the model’s performance on a held-out test set to ensure it performs well on unseen data.

Example
Here is a simple example of how to run the model training:

python
Copy code
from model import train_model

# Load your data
data = load_data('path/to/your/data.csv')

# Train the model
model = train_model(data)

# Save the model
model.save('path/to/save/model.h5')
